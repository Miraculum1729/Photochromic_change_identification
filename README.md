# Image-Based Detection of Photochromic Changes

This project provides a simple program for automatically identifying changes in images.
The code analyzes a series of images and detects regions where noticeable color changes occur (for example, areas that turn purple). Each detected region is assigned a number based on the order in which the change appears.

These numbers are then combined into a “password” that represents the sequence of photochromic changes observed in the images.
The program also compares the detected sequence with a predefined correct sequence and reports whether the result is correct.

In short, this code allows a computer to “look at images,” recognize visual changes, and convert them into clear, numerical results that can be easily checked and reproduced.
